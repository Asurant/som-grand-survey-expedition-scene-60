# som-grand-survey-expedition-scene-60
Scene 60 of Summer Of Making Grand Expedition

AI was used but was mainly for bug fixing and portions of the code. Mainly the CSS though because I'm not that great in making a website look good. Side effects of never being taught web design I guess.

This is only my contribution to the event and if you want to properly see the whole thing go to: https://github.com/hackclub/som-grand-survey-expedition
